# Azure Automation Account 


 


All the automation components such as runbooks, Hybrid Worker Groups, assets and Desired State Configuration configuration are stored in an Automation Account. The Automation account provides a security and automation management boundary for Azure Automation. The Automation Account also specifies the Azure subscription to be billed for Automation usage. 


 


 


Guidance 

When scoping and creating automation accounts, be vigilant about selecting a location to ensure that all Automation components are stored in a particular Azure region and consider the limit of 25 accounts per subscription. 


Segregate duties within your team and grant only the amount of access to users, groups, and applications that they need to perform their jobs. 


The recommended method is to use an Azure Run As account.  


To avoid impacting your runbooks and the processes they automate, you should first test any runbooks that have linked schedules with an Automation account dedicated for testing. This validates your scheduled runbooks continue to work correctly and if not, you can further troubleshoot and apply any changes required before migrating the updated runbook version to production. 


Integrate the Automation Account with source control to enable team collaboration, track changes, roll back to earlier versions, define branches for development, test or production Automation accounts.
