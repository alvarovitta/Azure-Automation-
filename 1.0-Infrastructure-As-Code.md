# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Overview

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice which enables the automation and validation of creation and teardown of environments to help with delivering secure and stable application hosting platforms.

IaC is a carefully named concept: as the name implies, IoC prefers proven software development practices and tools to manage cloud infrastructure over traditional infrastructure management approaches and tools.
IoC is a key enbaled of cloud adoption. At the same time, the approach comes expects organizations are willing to:

1. build closer collaboration between development and operations team
2. commit the time, motivation, and budget to build new skills

Common tools are just the beginning: businesses need to ensure they have the right
people, skills, and processes in place as well if they are to achieve the broadest range of IaC benefits. See [Infrastructure As Code: Fueling The Fire For Faster Application Delivery - Forrester TLP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46403)


## Guidance

* Development and operations responsabilities and processes will change. But each team will only do so if they are given time and encouragement.
* Review current provisioning and configuration processes to find points of friction between the Ops and Dev
teams.
* Build processes to allow for collaboration and minimize points of friction. Aim to release more frequently, test more often, and have fewer errors that cause friction and delays.
* Start small and learn as you grow. Identigy quick-wins that will motivate the teams to deploy IaC more widely.
* Identify applications that change frequently or are the subject to frequent issues, or where testing is particularly complex or time-consuming.
* Focus your efforts on aggressive automation and standardization, using common tools to simplify implementation.
