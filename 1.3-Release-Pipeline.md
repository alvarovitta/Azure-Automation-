# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Overview



## When to use


## Guidance



* Each customer environment should be evaluated for existing toolsets used for on-premises or public cloud automation.  Customers may wish to leverage existing expertise and investments in existing toolsets and extend the on-premises functionality to support the automation of Azure constructs.

* Irrespective of tolling, the automation approach should ensure idempotance, immutability, repeatability, testability, and versioning.

## Preparation

* **Create a Visual Studio Team Services Account**
To start building Infrastructure as Code with VSTS you need a VSTS account. If you donâ€™t have a VSTS account, you can create one at https://www.visualstudio.com. This is free for up to 5 users. Within the VSTS Account you create,you then create a new project with a Git repository. The next step is to get some infrastructure definition pushed to the repository.

## Procedure
