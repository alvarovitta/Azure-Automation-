# Azure Resource Manager 


## Overview 
The Azure Resource Manager (ARM) provides a consistent  management layer for the description, deployment, and control of Azure resources. As such, it is an essential building block of the Azure Automation capabilities. 

ARM acts as a lifecycle container and offers a declarative solution for deployment which guarantees the end-state each time the deployment is executed. 


|**Concept** | **Description** |
| -------------| -------------|
|Resource Group |Tightly coupled containers of multiple resources of similar or different types  
| |Lifecycle: deployment, update, delete, status  
| |Identity: resources can talk to each other  
| |Grouping: Metering, billing, quota: applied & rolled up to group 
| |Every resource must exist in one and only one resource group 
| |Resource groups can span regions 
| |Tags 
|RBAC |Allows secure access with granular permissions to resources 
| |Assignable to users, groups or service principals 
| |Built-in roles make it easy to get started 
|Azure Templates |Ensure Idempotency 
| |Simplify Orchestration 
| |Simplify Roll-back 
| |Provide Cross-Resource Configuration and Update Support  
| |Azure Templates are:  
| |Source file, checked-in 
| |Specifies resources and dependencies (VMs, WebSites, DBs) and connections (config, LB sets) 
| |Parametized input/output|

## Guidance 

- [Resource Group Guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#guidance) 

  - Define and deploy your infrastructure through the declarative syntax in Resource Manager templates, rather than through imperative commands. 
  - Declarative model for the ARM templates â€“ use imperative commands for resource management 
  - Define all deployment and configuration steps in the template. You should have no manual steps for setting up your solution. 
  - Run imperative commands to manage your resources, such as to start or stop an app or machine. 
  - Arrange resources with the same lifecycle in a resource group. Use tags for all other organizing of resources. 

- All the resources in your group should share the same lifecycle. You deploy, update, and delete them together. If one resource, such as a database server, needs to exist on a different deployment cycle it should be in another resource group. 
- A resource group can be used to scope access control for administrative actions. 
- Leverage Quickstart templates
