# Azure Automation

## Overview

Many things change in the cloud but the accountability around governing, securing,  protecting, monitoring, and configuring remain unchanged. However, new cloud management principles and capabilities have emerged given the scale and pace of change of cloud operations. In this respect the cloud is as much an operating model as it is a technology foundations.

Azure Automation is one such pervasive capability that fundamentally changes approaches to IT service management. Azure Automation scenarios fall into the following categories:

|Category|Example|
|--------|--------|
|Capacity Management|Notify users of a subscription who have underutilized VMS and perform remediation|
|Provisioning| Enable regeneration of storage Account keys while avoiding downtime in the application.|
|Monitoring|Deploy anew service to Azure and configure the end points for CPU and memory alerts|
|Backup|Backup and restore laaS VMs, SQL Backup on a schedule.-|
|Compliance|Monitor for when a new service gets created and configure it for the right tracing/backup policy|
|Patching|Patch Azure laaS VMs without downtime, leveraging Traffic Manager|
|Disaster Recovery| Automate failover activities to support business continuity objectives.
|Change Control|Deploy from Git run validation tests, and swap to production if tests pass|
|VM Lifecycle Management|Deploy a VM on Azure/on-premises cloud and enable monitoring for the VM.|
|Remediation|Alert on a VM then turn on tracing collect logs, upload to Azure Storage, and make available in Visual Studio for troubleshooting. See [Use an Alert to Trigger a runbook]|

Automation lower costs and improve predictability by enabling IT staff to focus on work that adds business value and reducing error-prone manual activities while lowering costs.

## Guidance
From an operations perspective, the cloud operating model disrupts the traditional ITSM processes. The importance of automation to service operations is well described in: [Modern Services Management for Azure Whitepaper](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/b6ea597e-2ca2-4bfb-9adc-c8d7292bc81a/Modern%20Service%20Management%20for%20Azure%20v1.1.pdf).


- The decision to automate, or not automate, should be based on the value over time. This is a question of comparing manual effort to the effort to automate and determining the amount of time it takes to break even.

- Hybrid Automation

  - Azure Automation cannot access Orchestrator or SMA runbooks. This can be a significant design consideration if an existing investment in automation platforms is required.

  - Whether it is self-hosted in Azure or on-premises, these platforms cannot be leveraged for a hybrid automation solution. Typically, Azure Automation would be used in a scenario to deploy or manipulate Azure resources, while additional automation could be used for post-provisioning automation actions when existing automation runbooks already exist for an on-premises resource configuration. Solution designs that require both automation environments should consider the tradeoffs associated with complex or multiple automation solutions.

  - For hybrid automation, consider migrating existing Orchestrator runbooks to Azure Automation and using Hybrid Runbook Workers on-premises.

  - Though System Center Orchestrator can be used as an automation solution for Azure, it is not a preferred solution.  If there has been significant investment in Orchestrator runbooks, consider Migrating them to Azure Automation and use Hybrid Runbook Workers.
