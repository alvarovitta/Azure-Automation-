# Azure Automation Overview


## Overview  

Many things change in the cloud but the accountability around governing, securing,  protecting, monitoring, and configuring remain unchanged. However, new cloud management principles and capabilities have emerged given the scale and pace of change of cloud operations. In this respect the cloud is as much an operating model as it is a technology foundations.  

Azure Automation is one such pervasive capability that fundamentally changes approaches to IT service management. Azure Automation scenarios fall into the following categories: 

- Capacity Management
- Provisioning
- Monitoring
- Backup
- Compliance
- Dev / Test Environments 
- Patching
- Disaster Recovery 
- Change Control 
- VM Lifecycle Management 
- Remediation 


Automation lower costs and improve predictability by enabling IT staff to focus on work that adds business value and reducing error-prone manual activities while lowering costs. 

Illustrative  automation examples  include: 

- Patch/update/backup orchestration 
- Change control and provisioning  
- Monitoring and remediation  
- Patch Azure laaS VMs without downtime, leveraging Traffic Manager. 

- Deploy a VM on Azure/on-premises cloud and enable monitoring for the VM.  
- Alert on a VM then turn on tracing collect logs, upload to Azure Storage, and make available in Visual Studio for troubleshooting. See [Use an Alert to Trigger a runbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-create-alert-triggered-runbook). 
- Enable regeneration of storage Account keys while avoiding downtime in the application.  
- Deploy anew service to Azure and configure the end points for CPU and memory alerts.  
- Monitor for when a new service gets created and configure it for the right tracing/backup policy.  
- SQL Backup on a schedule.  
- Deploy from Git run validation tests, and swap to production if tests pass.  
- Notify users of a subscription who have underutilized VMS and perform remediation.  
- Backup and restore laaS VMs 
- Monitor SharePoint online for an to update a service and update the service once

## Guidance 
From an operations perspective, the cloud operating model disrupts the traditional ITSM processes. The importance of automation to service operations is well described in: [Modern Services Management for Azure Whitepaper](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/b6ea597e-2ca2-4bfb-9adc-c8d7292bc81a/Modern%20Service%20Management%20for%20Azure%20v1.1.pdf). 

Irrespective of tolling, the automation approach should ensure idempotance, immutability, repeatability, testability, and versioning

- The decision to automate, or not automate, should be based on the value over time. This is a question of comparing manual effort to the effort to automate and determining the amount of time it takes to break even. 


- Each customer environment should be evaluated for existing toolsets used for on-premises or public cloud automation.  

  - Customers may wish to leverage existing expertise and investments in existing toolsets and extend the on-premises functionality to support the automation of Azure constructs. 

  - However, other organizations may wish to have the automation supporting Azure handled separately, without dependencies on legacy or existing platforms. This discovery of each organization’s environment and automation strategy should serve as an input into the overall automation architecture. 


- Hybrid Automation  

  - Azure Automation cannot access Orchestrator or SMA runbooks. This can be a significant design consideration if an existing investment in automation platforms is required.  

  - Whether it is self-hosted in Azure or on-premises, these platforms cannot be leveraged for a hybrid automation solution. Typically, Azure Automation would be used in a scenario to deploy or manipulate Azure resources, while additional automation could be used for post-provisioning automation actions when existing automation runbooks already exist for an on-premises resource configuration. Solution designs that require both automation environments should consider the tradeoffs associated with complex or multiple automation solutions.  

  - For hybrid automation, consider migrating existing Orchestrator runbooks to Azure Automation and using Hybrid Runbook Workers on-premises. 

  - Though System Center Orchestrator can be used as an automation solution for Azure, it is not a preferred solution.  If there has been significant investment in Orchestrator runbooks, consider Migrating them to Azure Automation and use Hybrid Runbook Workers.
