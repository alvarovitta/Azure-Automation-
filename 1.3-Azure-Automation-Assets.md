# Azure Automation Assets 


Azure Automation Assets are resources (also called “settings”) that are globally available to be used in or associated with a runbook.

Schedules 
 


Azure Automation Schedules are used to schedule runbooks to run automatically.  This could be either a single date and time for the runbook to run once, or it could be a recurring schedule to start the runbook multiple times 
 



Integration Modules 
 


An integration module is a package that contains a Windows PowerShell Module and can be imported into Azure Automation.  Imported modules are distributed to all Azure Automation worker servers so that they are available to runbooks. 
 



Connections 
 


Connections define the information required to connect to a service or application from a runbook.  The different types of connections  are defined by the integration modules imported into Automation, and typically include such information credentials the host or service URI to connect to.  This information can then be passed as one or more parameters to the integration modules activities, to make required connections. 
 



Variables 
 


Variables are values that are available to all runbooks.  They can be created, modified, and retrieved from the Azure Portal, Windows PowerShell,  or from within a runbook.   


They can be used in runbooks to define frequently-used settings, such as directory paths to common files, server names, or other strings.  


Variable settings store string, boolean, integer, or datetime information that can then be used in a runbook. They can also contain complex objects (stored as property bags). 
 



Credentials and Certificates 
 


Credentials are either a username and password combination that can be used with Windows PowerShell commands or a certificate that is uploaded to Azure Automation. The properties for a credential are stored securely in Automation, and can be accessed in the runbook with either the Get-AutomationPSCredential or Get-AutomationCertificate activity. 
 


 


 


 


Guidance 

Variables are created to:  

Share a value between multiple runbooks. 


Share a value between multiple jobs from the same runbook.  


Manage a value from the Azure Portal or from the Windows PowerShell command line that is used by runbooks 



Azure Automation created Connection type asset to: 

Group the connection data necessary to connect to an external system into a single object so that it can be accessed by runbooks easily  


Provide a template describing how a connection for a certain system should look like so that users can use this template when defining the connection to this system  


Changes to the connection data can be made in a single place without having to replicate the change in multiple locations (variable assets, runbooks, etc)   



Use Azure Automation credentials as a unified and secure way to store and reference credentials in runbooks.
