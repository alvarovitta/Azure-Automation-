# Azure Scheduler 

Azure Scheduler is a service for scheduling reliable actions on a recurrent or calendar aware-basis, executed reliably even in the face of network, machine, and data center failures. Scheduler can invoke actions—such as calling HTTP/S endpoints or posting a message to a storage queue on any schedule. Scheduler can schedule jobs to call services both inside and outside of  Azure and run those jobs on demand, on a regularly recurring schedule, or designate them for a future date.  


**Job collection:**  A job collection contains a group of jobs and maintains settings, quotas, and throttles that are shared by jobs within the collection. A job collection is created by a subscription owner and groups jobs together based on usage or application boundaries. It’s constrained to one region. It also allows the enforcement of quotas to constrain the usage of all jobs in that collection. The quotas include MaxJobs and MaxRecurrence. 
 
**Job:** A job defines a single recurrent action, with simple or complex strategies for execution. Actions may include HTTP, storage queue, service bus queue, or service bus topic requests. 
 
**Job history:**  A job history represents details for an execution of a job. It contains success vs. failure, as well as any response details. 

Schedules for many behavior patterns, including:  
- Run once at a specific date and time. 
- Run and recur a specific number of times. 
- Run immediately and recur. 
- Run and recur every n minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months, starting at a specific time. 
- Run and recur at a weekly or monthly frequency, but only on specific days of the week or on specific days of the month. 
- Run and recur multiple times in a period. For example, on the last Friday and last Monday of every month, or at 5:15 AM and at 


## Guidance 

| Job Type        | Usage           | 
| ------------- |-------------|
|HTTP jobs (including HTTPS jobs that support SSL)| HTTP jobs used against existing endpoints for a  workload or service |
|storage queue jobs | Storage queue jobs can be used to to post messages to storage queues  for workloads that use storage queue |
|service bus queue and topic jobs |Service bus jobs are ideal for workloads that use service bus queues and topics|

## Procedure:  How to Create a Job 

1. Create a Job 
  a. Use the Azure portal to [create a job]() 
  b. Use JSON and the REST API to [create a schedule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/scheduler/scheduler-advanced-complexity#use-json-and-the-rest-api-to-create-a-schedule) 

2. Manage and Monitor Jobs 
  [Manage and monitor jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/scheduler/scheduler-get-started-portal#manage-and-monitor-jobs)
